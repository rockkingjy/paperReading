Given a query street-view image, this paper aims to find where it was taken by matching it to a city-scale aerial view image database, using a CNN.

Key idea is to learn the relationship between "ground level appearance" and "over-head appearance" and "land cover attributes" from sparsely available geotagged ground-level images.
